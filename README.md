## About

Life is becoming too busy to get medical appointments in person and to maintain a proper health care. We aim to create a real-time website which provides ease and comfort to patients for finding appropriate doctor and book an appointment sitting at home.
We intend to create a dynamic website through which patients can get details of all the doctors at one place, check for appointment availability and book appointment online. Using this website, doctors can limit appointment slots to maintain time bounds.
